# Section 1

## Introduction

FIDDLE stands for a "**F**lex**i**ble **D**ata-**D**riven Preprocessing Pipe**l**in**e**." This acronym is a bit of a stretch, but it is a useful tool for preprocessing data to obtain features for machine learning algorithms.

The FIDDLE algorithm has been developed in Python [link to the github repo](https://github.com/MLD3/FIDDLE), but I would like to implement it in R for the purposes of this class final project.
